### Todo

- [ ] Import .proto is better than just copypasta
- [ ] Create Release Pipeline
- [ ] Better error management, errors send to Discord are too descriptive
- [ ] When backend didn't respond in time, should put request on bus and have a link to see status
- [ ] Must Create a pretty README but i didn't defined pretty yet
- [ ] Must Create more logs, but what the best way to propagate logger to sub functions ?
- [ ] Pretty sure I commented every function the other day... did i ?
- [ ] This project test coverage is awful, should i mention that i want to use TDD ?
